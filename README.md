# Hangman

This is a simple hangman game that is played in the terminal.

## How to play

The user is prompted to pick a length of word to play with, with the choice to choose a random length. Then, the user has 6 guesses and the hangman is built as the user plays.

## How to use

Download all the files and keep them in the same directory. Only "hangman.py" needs to be ran.
